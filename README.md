# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

Name: AP computer Science A 
Description: AP Computer Science A is equivalent to a first-semester, college-level CS1 course in computer science. The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using the Java programming language. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems
Pre-requisite: Algebra I

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Online text: CSAwesome Runestone Course (Available for free)

Detailed outline of the course content: 
Unit 1. Getting Started and Primitive Types
Unit 2. Using Objects
Unit 3. Boolean Expressions and If Statements	
Unit 4. Iteration (Loops)
Unit 5. Writing Classes
Unit 6. Arrays
Unit 7. ArrayList
Unit 8. 2D Arrays
Unit 9. Inheritance
Unit 10. Recursion



## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

Programming Environment: Java programming language
Online site: Students code in the Active Code windows built into the CSAwesome online course.
Software: The online IDE replit

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

Google chromebook specs???

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.



### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
