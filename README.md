# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

Name: AP computer Science A 

Description: AP Computer Science A is equivalent to a first-semester, college-level CS1 course in computer science. The course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design using the Java programming language. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems

Pre-requisite: Algebra I

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Online text: CSAwesome Runestone Course (Available for free)

Detailed outline of the course content: 
- Unit 1. Getting Started and Primitive Types

- Unit 2. Using Objects

- Unit 3. Boolean Expressions and If Statements	

- Unit 4. Iteration (Loops)

- Unit 5. Writing Classes

- Unit 6. Arrays

- Unit 7. ArrayList

- Unit 8. 2D Arrays

- Unit 9. Inheritance

- Unit 10. Recursion

Students needs to complete C- or above

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

Programming Environment: Java programming language
Online site: Students code in the Active Code windows built into the CSAwesome online course.
Software: The online IDE replit

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

Google chromebook specs???

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

The course has a lab component in which students will finish a minimum of 20 hours of lab experiences. The purpose is to give students hands-on experiences. The lab consists of small coding assignments. The assignments ranges from something easy to somthing challenging. In the lab, students are encouraged to do pair programming. In addition, students will finish all of the following College Board AP Computer Sceince A labs:

MagPie Chatbot lab 
Consumer Review Lab
Celebrity Lab
Steganography Lab
Data Lab

Assessments

Quizzes and Exams
Pre and Post Test built into the curriculum
Practice exams built into the curriculum
Personal Progress Checks provided by the College Board as formative assessments

Self-Check and Coding Exercises
Multiple choice questions, Parsons problems, and Active Code Exercises including a Programming Challenge are built into each lesson for each CS A topic. 

AP CS A Exam
Students who complete this course will be prepared to take the AP CS A Exam in May.


### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

Class Resiliency
1. Students are encouraged to identify their personal goals. The personal goals consist of 5 factors: specific; measurable; attainable; relevant; and timely. For example, the goal could look like this: "I will take notes and review them at least two days before test and quizzes so that I can ask the teacher questions about what I don’t understand. I will try to do the programming to see whether it works before I do it with my peers in the lab because I want to test my idea and if it doesn't work, I will share it with my peers or I will learn the better way from my peers. When I get anything wrong, I will make sure to ask the teacher or one of my peers how they got the right answer.”

2. Teacher models learning mistakes by creating a classroom where failure is an expected part of learning. Students are not just praised for their hard work, grades and easy success but also students are held accountable for every piece of work they are doing so that they feel ownership and internal reward.

3. Students are taught to understand the difficulty of the programming. When students move along the course, some of them might think that the programming might not be their "cup of tea". It is OK to feel this way and students are taught to become self-aware of their difficult emotions and manage their emotion effectively. Students are encouraged to share such feeling with their teachers.
